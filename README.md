# Filters - Image Manipulation Project

## Introduction

This project aims to explore the concept of image representation using grids of pixels and to implement various image filters using the Python programming language.

## Description

An image is represented as a grid of pixels, where each pixel can have different color values. For black-and-white images, 1 bit per pixel is sufficient (0 for black, 1 for white). For colorful images, more bits per pixel are needed. Common file formats like BMP, JPEG, and PNG support different color depths. A 24-bit BMP, for example, uses 8 bits for red, green, and blue colors (RGB).

## Features

This project includes the following features:

1. **Image Filters:**
   - Implement various image filters such as grayscale, sepia, blur, and edge detection.
   
2. **Pixel Manipulation:**
   - Manipulate individual pixel values to achieve desired effects.

3. **Image Manipulation:**
   - Manipulate images by flipping/reversing them horizontally and vertically.
   
3. **File Format Support:**
   - Handle common image file formats like BMP, JPEG, and PNG for input and output.

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need Python installed on your system. Clone this repository and install the required dependencies.
